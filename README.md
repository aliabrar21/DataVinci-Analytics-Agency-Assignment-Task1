Here’s a **README.md** file you can use for your ReactJS project (the nested checkbox UI).

```markdown
# Nested Checkbox React App

This project is a **ReactJS application** that demonstrates a **nested checkbox logic** where selecting a parent category automatically selects/deselects all its child items, and selecting/deselecting child items updates the parent checkbox state.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Parent-child checkbox synchronization.
- "Select All" behavior for parent checkboxes.
- Partially checked state for parents when some children are selected.
- Clean and responsive UI using **CSS**.
